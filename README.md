These are my solutions for problems from the
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs)
book.

I'm using mit-scheme and Emacs (with
[Evil](https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home) mode). To get a REPL inside emacs,
I use `run-scheme`. Some useful shortcuts are:
- `C-M-x` send current definition
- `C-c C-l` load file
- `C-x C-e` eval last sexp
